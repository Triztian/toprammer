=== DEPENDENCIES ===

* Python 2.5 or Python 2.6 is required
* python-usb module is required


=== INSTALLATION ===

No installation is required. Just execute the "toprammer" file.


=== USAGE ===

A .BIT file is always needed to do operations on the inserted chip.
The .BIT file must match the chip. For example, do do operations on an
Atmel Mega8 DIP microcontroller, the atmega8dip28.bit file is needed.
Currently, the only way to get these files is to extract them from the
Windows installation of the original "Topwin" software. Just go to the
"Topwin" install directory (C:\Top\Topwin5\) and copy the "blib2"
subdirectory to an USB stick (or something else) to transfer them
to the Linux machine.

The .BIT file basically is the firmware that runs on the FPGA in the
TOP2049 programmer. An opensource alternative to these files is planned,
but currently unavailable.

See toprammer --help for device actions to read/write stuff from/to
the chip.

Example:

	Reading the flash of an Atmel Mega8 DIP to the file flash.img:
	toprammer --bitfile atmega8dip28.bit --read-prog flash.img
