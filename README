=== DEPENDENCIES ===

* Python 2.5 or Python 2.6 is required
* python-usb module is required



=== SUPPORTED CHIPS ===

   Chip                               | State
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   Atmel Mega8 DIP28                  | Fully supported



=== INSTALLATION ===

No installation is required. Just execute the "toprammer" file.



=== USAGE ===

A .BIT file is always needed to do operations on the inserted chip.
The .BIT file must match the chip. For example, do do operations on an
Atmel Mega8 DIP microcontroller, the atmega8dip28.bit file is needed.
Prebuilt .BIT files can be found in the "bit/" subdirectory.
Sourcecode for these .BIT files is located in "bit/src/".

The .BIT file basically is the firmware that runs on the FPGA in the
TOP2049 programmer.

See toprammer --help for device actions to read/write stuff from/to
the chip.

Example:

	Reading the flash of an Atmel Mega8 DIP to the file flash.img:
	toprammer --bitfile atmega8dip28.bit --read-prog flash.img
